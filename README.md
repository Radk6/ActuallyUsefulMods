# Actually Useful Mods

This is a fork of the UsefulMods list by NordicGamerFE/TheUsefulLists. It was created because the original list lacked quite a few mods and had some pretty useless categories (like "Launchers"). Credits: [NordicGamerFE/TheUsefulLists](https://github.com/TheUsefulLists/UsefulMods), [Alkyaly](https://gist.github.com/alkyaly/02830c560d15256855bc529e1e232e88), [Makamys](https://gist.github.com/makamys/7cb74cd71d93a4332d2891db2624e17c)

| Unstable | Mod is unstable and may act unpredictably. |
| Corruption | Mod has a chance to corrupt save files. |
| Incompatible | Mod is incompatible with some mods. |
| Buggy | Mod is buggy. |
| Reverse Features | Mod takes away features for sake of performance or bugfixes. |
| Configuration Needed | Mod needs to be configured to act at its best. |

## Severity Level

## Extra Information

You might find some superscripted numbers around the repository. These are used to tell extra information about the mods that labels and danger levels do not apply to.

###### ¹ The mod should work if [Mixin-0-7-0-8-Compatibility](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/mixin-0-7-0-8-compatibility) is applied

###### ² Cull Particles isn't needed anymore in newer Forge versions, as it was implemented in Forge

###### ³ Do not blame me if you didn't read this notice. *If you try to load a older world in a newer instance of the game, and you have one of these mods installed, bad things will happen*, make sure to uninstall the mod first

###### ⁴ Some of the mods that have Sodium as an incompatibility, might work if you use [Indium](https://modrinth.com/mod/indium)

###### ⁵ AI Improvements newer versions (1.14+) don't have as much impact as the older versions have, since in newer versions of Minecraft, a lot of fixes to the AI are implemented ([Sources: Curseforge page FAQ, [Dev](https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/254806806516203520/831525756143534150/unknown.png)])

###### ⁶ These mods also work on 1.17.x , despite having only 1.16 and 1.18 releases in curseforge, no workarounds needed. Install them like any other mods and your fabric loader won't complain about missing dependencies
